## üß† Behind the Scenes
>[!IMPORTANT]
> This was my first big dive into **React Three Fiber**, **Blender workflows**, and **web-based game design**.  
> All the models used are under free-use licenses and credit goes to their respective owners, All I did was optimized and exported them as GLTF, and integrated them into the scene using R3F.

I also learned:
- Managing complex 3D scenes with performance in mind
- Complex React workflows and 'wiring up' the components
- Global State management with Zustand
- Integrating physics and interactions (in progress for v2!)
- Optimizing for web deployment and responsiveness
